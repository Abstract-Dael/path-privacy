        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: September 2025</p>
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Your privacy matters.</strong> Path stores your goals, progress, and personal media exclusively on your device. We only collect what's necessary to provide authentication, and we never sell your data to third parties.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Path is designed with privacy as a core principle. Unlike many apps, we store nearly all of your data locally on your device, not in the cloud. This means your goals, progress, and personal photos stay with you.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Authentication Information (Stored in Firebase):</strong></p>
    <p>When you sign in with Apple, we collect only what's needed to create and maintain your account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your unique user identifier</li>
        <li>Your email address</li>
        <li>Your display name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is stored securely in Firebase Authentication.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Goal and Progress Data (Stored Locally on Your Device):</strong></p>
    <p>All of your actual app content is stored exclusively on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Goal titles and target numbers</li>
        <li>Your personal reasons and meanings for each goal</li>
        <li>Daily progress entries, including amounts and dates</li>
        <li>Mood selections and personal notes</li>
        <li>Completion status and tracking history</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> This data is not uploaded to our servers or synced to the cloud. It exists only on your device.</p>
    
    <p><strong>"Remember Your Why" Photos and Videos (Stored Locally):</strong></p>
    <p>When you save photos or videos as motivational reminders:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>These files are stored in your device's local cache</li>
        <li>They are never uploaded to any server or cloud storage</li>
        <li>Only you can access these files</li>
        <li>They will be deleted if you delete the app</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Usage Information:</strong></p>
    <p>We collect minimal analytics to help us understand how Path is used and to fix bugs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device type and iOS version</li>
        <li>App version and crash reports</li>
        <li>General feature usage (which screens are visited)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>
    
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authenticate your identity when you sign in</li>
        <li>Display your goals and progress back to you</li>
        <li>Show your personal photos and videos in the app</li>
        <li>Improve app stability and performance</li>
        <li>Provide customer support when requested</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>We never:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sell your information to third parties</li>
        <li>Use your goals or progress for advertising</li>
        <li>Share your data with other users</li>
        <li>Access or analyze your personal photos or videos</li>
        <li>Track your behavior across other apps or websites</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Cloud Storage (Firebase Authentication Only):</strong></p>
    <p>Your authentication credentials are securely stored in Firebase, which provides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encryption in transit and at rest</li>
        <li>Industry-standard security protocols</li>
        <li>Regular security audits by Google</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Local Device Storage:</strong></p>
    <p>The majority of your data—including all goals, progress entries, and personal media—is stored exclusively on your device using:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>iOS secure file system</li>
        <li>Your device's built-in encryption</li>
        <li>Standard iOS security protections</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your personal data never leaves your device</li>
        <li>We cannot access your goals, progress, or photos</li>
        <li>Your data will not sync across multiple devices</li>
        <li>Deleting the app will permanently remove all local data</li>
        <li>Backing up your device with iCloud will preserve your data</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    
    <p>Path uses minimal third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Authentication (Google):</strong> Securely manages your sign-in credentials</li>
        <li><strong>Sign in with Apple:</strong> Provides authentication without sharing unnecessary personal information</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These services have their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Your Rights and Control</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Access Your Data:</strong> All your data is visible within the app at any time. Your goals, progress, and media are always accessible to you.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Delete Your Data:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete individual goals, progress entries, or photos anytime from within the app</li>
        <li>Delete your entire account from Settings, which removes your authentication credentials from our servers</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app to remove all locally stored data from your device</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Disconnect Your Account:</strong> You can sign out or disconnect your Apple ID from Settings at any time.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Control Notifications:</strong> Manage notification preferences through your iOS Settings app.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    
    <p>Because most of your data is stored locally on your device, it remains there until you delete it or uninstall the app.</p>
    
    <p>For data we store in Firebase (authentication only):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your account information is retained as long as your account is active</li>
        <li>When you delete your account, we permanently remove your authentication data within 30 days</li>
        <li>Anonymized crash reports and analytics may be retained for up to 90 days</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page</li>
        <li>Notify you through the app if changes are significant</li>
        <li>Post the updated policy at this URL</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Your continued use of Path after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
    
    <h2>International Users</h2>
    
    <p>Path is available worldwide. Your authentication data may be processed in the United States or other countries where Firebase operates. By using Path, you consent to the transfer of your authentication information to these locations. Your goals, progress, and media remain on your local device regardless of your location.</p>
    
    <h2>California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
    
    <p>If you're a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> You can request information about what personal data we've collected</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You can request deletion of your personal information</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out:</strong> We don't sell personal information, so there's nothing to opt out of</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> We won't discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at the email address below.</p>
